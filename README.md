# SENG550-AirFareProject
Project repo for the SENG550 final project

Most of the work was done in proj.py as the model was trained and analyzed locally rather than in a notebook file like on databricks
The included zipped dataset in this repo is a 30MB cut down version of the original 32GB dataset from kaggle found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dilwong/flightprices)
